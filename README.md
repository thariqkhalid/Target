The bill file 878355.TIF need to be present in the same folder as the python file ocr_bill.py.
Command for running:
    python ocr_bill.py
This version only supports the above mentioned bill because identification of the handwritten area is yet another pattern recognition problem which I'll cover later. 
# In this implementation, I've focused only on completing the pipeline for segmentation and OCR.
Accuracy has to be improved since it's very bad at this stage. It can be improved a lot with simple debugging.
